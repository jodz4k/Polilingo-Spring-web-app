# Polilingo-Spring-web-app

ðŸ“˜ The application has a language theme and should assist users in learning foreign languages. Users can be administrators and members (users who are learning languages). It should work based on the principle of selecting words that are known and unknown in a particular language. The software would offer users daily new words of a certain difficulty level that users categorize into specific groups: know and don't know. Users would be asked which languages they would like to learn, and that would be displayed on their profile. In addition to new words, users would also receive context on how a particular word is used. All functionalities would be available only to registered users. Users also have the option to add friends. Friends can set goals to achieve together. ðŸŒŸ
